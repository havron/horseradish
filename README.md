# Horseradish

Because practicing takes patience, hardiness, and a little kick. Also, it's [worth its weight in gold.](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/20/style/q-horseradish-a-boosts-flavor-b-is-too-hot-c-heals.html)

**Horseradish** is a lightweight app for practicing coding. Some features it could do would include:
* Submission metrics
* [Codemirror, a nice editing interface](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html)
* A notion of "practice sessions", which would include features to help structure the sessions/pacing as well as keep morale up with silly GIFs.

The basic architecture is Flask-RESTful, and is inspired by [netflix
lemur](https://github.com/Netflix/lemur).
